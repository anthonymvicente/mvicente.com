                My name is Anthony and I'm a software developer in Lincoln, Nebraska. I currently work for <a href="https://www.rentping.com" target="_blank">Rentping</a> creating websites and marketing management software for apartment communities. I work primarily in several web development technologies (HTML using Mustache, CSS using Less, Javascript, etc.) for website creation and Java for back-end systems. I graduated from the University of Nebraska - Lincoln in 2015 with a degree in Computer Science. At UNL, I focused my classes on algorithms and system administration. After graduating, I worked for the university as part of NeSIS (Nebraska Student Information System) for nearly three years. Beyond work, my Computer Science interests are in cryptography and computer security. Outside of work, I enjoy photography, games (both video and board), and reading (mostly science fiction or non-fiction in the realm of, you guessed it, computer science). Although I do occasionally work on personal projects to strengthen my development skills outside of work, I've found that exploring my other interests helps maintain a good balance and enjoy both to a greater degree.
