                        My name is Anthony and I'm a software developer in Lincoln, Nebraska. I graduated from the University of Nebraska - Lincoln (UNL) with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and currently work for Nebraska Student Information Services (NeSIS) where I design and develop software for the universities and state colleges throughout Nebraska. I began an internship with NeSIS in December, 2013 and was hired on full time in May 2015 after graduating. I work on both student and staff facing software for all departments within the universities, primarily written in PeopleCode, Oracles proprietary programming language for the PeopleSoft system, along with SQL and occasionally Java. Although I do some front-end design/development, a majority of my work is on back-end systems, including integrating with third-party companies via web services and system security enhancements.

                        Beyond work my CS interests generally lie in cryptography and cybersecurity. I first became intrigued with cryptography after reading a short book on the history of the subject that spanned from the simple Caesar cipher up through the development of Public-key Cryptography. As a natural extension of this interest coupled with my career I've also become interested in cybersecurity concepts, a modern day application of cryptography and other security practices. In order to step away from the computer I also took an interest in photography. At the time of writing this I've only just begun what I would consider serious photography and still have a long way to go. I generally enjoy landscape and more specifically cityscape photography, which ties into my desire to travel, though I also like portrait photography to mix things up. What I enjoy the most about photography is the combination of techniques and subjective style that allows for an interesting creativity.
